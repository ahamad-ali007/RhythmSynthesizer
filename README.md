# Hand Gesture Arpeggiator

Hand-controlled arpeggiator, drum machine, and audio reactive visualizer. Raise your hands to raise the roof!

An interactive web app built with threejs, mediapipe computer vision, rosebud AI, and tone.js.

- Hand #1 controls the arpeggios (raise hand to raise pitch, pinch to change volume)
- Hand #2 controls the drums (raise different fingers to change the pattern)


## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Camera access enabled for hand tracking

## Technologies

- **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and gesture recognition
- **Three.js** for audio reactive visual rendering
- **Tone.js** for synthesizer sounds
- **HTML5 Canvas** for visual feedback
- **JavaScript** for real-time interaction

## Setup for Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/RythmSynthesizer/arpeggiator

# Navigate to the project directory
cd arpeggiator

# Serve with your preferred method (example using Python)

My name is Alan, and I enjoy building open source software for computer vision, games, and more. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!
